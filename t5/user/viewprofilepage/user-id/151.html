					 We started the digital transformation (DT) discussion at a strategic level, where we talk about how DT must transform more than just the technology, but also the people process and culture of the entire company. Then we shifted to a more operational level and talk about why business must adopt Geoffrey Moore’s 4 gears model in order to survive the digital revolution. From this perspective, DT is simply the roadmap of the journey that transforms the business from a traditional 2-gears model to the new 4-gears model. 
 &nbsp; 
 Over the last 2 posts, we derived some practical tips from behavior economics that help practitioners overcome their company’s resistance to change. 
 
 The starting point of DT should be something your company is already doing—acquisition (i.e. marketing). 
 The ramp from acquisition to engagement, and then to enlistment will emerge naturally as a necesity for the continual success of your DT program. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Since this baby-steps approach is driven by success, it’s harder for enterprises to abandon the DT initiative during this multi-year journey, because they would be forgoing success. Although this provides an operation guideline for spinning the 4 gears, the specific of how you transform your marketing and what precisely you do to engage and enlist is dependent on your vision of DT. Moreover, the marketing technology landscape is huge and complex. And there are many ways you can transform your digital marketing operation. 
 &nbsp; 
 Today we will go back to the strategic level at the beginning, where we identified 3 ingredients that successful DT must have from the start. We have discussed many concepts and models around DT. The following picture is a good visual summary of what we’ve discussed so far.     
 &nbsp; 
 The Challenge of Connecting the Dots 
 Recall from the very first vlog of this mini-series, we found 3 initial ingredients that are crucial to the long-term success of your DT project. 
 
 A customer-centric strategy 
 A clear vision of what DT means to your brand 
 The right technology that is fully integrated into your digital ecosystem and simple to use 
 
 Although one can easily argue the importance of any one over the other two, they are all equally important. We must have all 3 of them, or we should wait until we have them all before we embark on the DT journey. In reality, the 3 success ingredients all influence each other. Creating a customer-centric DT strategy is always an iterative process, as is forging a vision and choosing the right technology. 
 &nbsp; 
 The challenge is that we now know the end state, and we have a way to get there with minimum corporate resistance (i.e. baby steps). This will further constrain the vision and the customer-centric strategy we can explore. Not all vision and strategy will bring us to the 4-gears end state. Of those that will get us there, not all will work with the baby steps approach we outlined. 
 &nbsp; 
 For example, your vision may be to transform your email marketing by using big data to better segment and target your audience. This can even be done in a customer-centric fashion to give customers a better customer experience (CX) by serving them hyper-relevant email that they want rather than spamming them. And you have chosen the best technology in the market that is simple to use. Although this vision encompasses all 3 success ingredients, the success of this DT initiative will not lead your company to spin the engagement gear. Because successful email marketing improves click through rate, which drives more traffic to your e-commerce sites and ultimately increases monetization. Evidently, we are back to the 2-gears model again. Albeit profitable in short-term, this won’t sustain and won’t save your business from being outcompeted by those who’ve learned to spin the 4 gears. 
 &nbsp; 
 Similarly, revamping your web analytics, SEO, webinar, or listening platform, probably won’t help your company spin the 4 gears either. Forging a vision or a customer-centric strategy under the constraints imposed by the 4-gears model and the baby steps principle is very hard, because we must connect all the dots in prospect. But without them, we risk either miss the boat at the end or suffer corporate resistant along the way, none of which we want. 
 &nbsp; 
 What is a Total Community?&nbsp; 
     In our experience, it’s often best for you to come up with a vision that’s compatible with your brand’s mission, because that should be unique to your company. But there is a customer-centric strategy that is consistent with the 4-gears model and connects all the dots along the way. It’s known as the total community strategy, and it involves engaging the true community of your brand on digital channels. The only disclaimer I like to point out is that this is not the only strategy that connects all the dots. However, it is one that I know is repeatable, because it’s been tested over many years of Lithium’s business operation. 
 &nbsp; 
 To understand total community, we have to understand the distinction between social networks and communities. Most social media practitioners probably do know the difference between these 2 social structures and treat them equivalently—they are all just social media. While this isn’t wrong, it misses some important properties that have limited many practitioners from realizing the full potential of their social media initiatives. In short, 
 
 A community is a group of people held together by some common interest. 
 A social network is a group of people held together by interpersonal relationships. 
 
 For a more detail exposition on this topic, please review my cyber-anthropology mini-series. If you really want to dive deep and understand the communication, structural, and mathematical distinction between communities and social network, I recommend following this academic discussion. 
 &nbsp; 
 Given this basic understanding of community, what is the true community of your brand? Most people probably think it’s your brand’s online community. This is not quite correct. Although the online community is certainly part of the true community of your brand, it is only a very small part of it. 
 &nbsp; 
 To answer this question more accurate, we have to use our definition of a community and ask, “Who are all the people who have a common interest around your brand?” The group of all people who have a common interest in your brand is the true community of your brand, regardless of where they may be. Your brand’s true community is defined by the shared interest about your brand, not the geographical or digital boundaries. This group certainly includes customers and prospects, but it also includes employees, partners, and influencers etc. To avoid confusion with the usual connotation of the word “community,” and to emphasize the breadth and completeness of your brand’s true community, we define to this group as the “total community” 
 &nbsp; 
 So, by definition, your brand’s total community is the true community of your brand. 
 &nbsp; 
 Total Community as a Customer Centric Strategy 
 The concept of total community can be quite confusing, because it can mean several different things depending on your vantage point. There are at least 3 perspectives that I am aware of. 
 
 From a social science perspective, the total community of your brand is, by definition, the group of people who have a common interest in your brand. So it’s just a group of people. I must ephasize that this group doesn’t include Your competitors surely have an interest in your brand, but it’s usually not a “common” interest. They are more interested in your demise than your success. 
 From a business persp    ective, total community is also a The total community strategy says brands must engage their total community (the group of people that constitute their true community) to provide them with an awesome CX wherever they may be. Since your total community consists of a very diverse group, they are dispersed across many digital channels. Some of your customers are certainly in your online community, but the majority of your customers are not. Yet, they are participants in various social networks. Your employees are inside your enterprise, and your partners and influencers may be on several 3rd party websites. The total community strategy says you must engage and provide excellent CX in all these digital channels (i.e. online customer communities, the greater social web, inside your enterprise, as well as 3rd party websites.). Like it or not, your total community is digitally distributed. 
 Finally, from a technology perspective, total community is also a technology platform that enables brands to engage their total community and give them great CX wherever they may be. So the total community platform is a software platform that helps brands provide exceptional and personalized CX while engaging their online customer communities, the greater social web, inside your company, as well as on 3rd party websites. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Conclusion 
 Now we have 3 different vantage point to help us understand DT. 
 
 The 4-gears model provides an image of how your business should operate near the end of your DT journey. It serves as a beacon to give you directions along the lengthy DT journey so you will never lose sight of your final goal. 
 DT is a roadmap that guides the business transformation process. It starts with the adoption of new digital technology, but need to manage the change of processes, employee behaviors, and the culture for the entire company. Since this is a multi-year journey, we’ve use behavior economics to help us overcome corporate inertia along the journey. 
 Finally, the total community strategy is the customer-centric strategy that helps shape your vision and guides the technology selection at the beginning of your DT initiative. This will ensure that you have all 3 success ingredients before you start the transformation process. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 We came a long way. In fact, we have traversed the DT journey from start to finish, and then back to the beginning again. Below are all the prior entries of this mini-series. Next time let’s try to wrap up this DT mini-series.

					 Welcome back to the 6th entry of this digital transformation (DT) mini-series. Over the course of this mini-series, we’ve learned a powerful framework (i.e. Geoffrey Moore’s 4-gears model) that help businesses survive and thrive in today’s digital economy. There is no doubt that the 4-gears model is related to DT, since both are trying to help companies survive the digital disruption, but their relationship isn’t obvious. I will fix this today before diving deeper into the behavior economics of successful DT. 
 &nbsp; 
 Since this post builds on the previous discussions of this mini-series, if you missed any of the earlier entries, it’s a good idea to review them before moving on: 
 
 Successful Digital Transformation Must Go Beyond Digital to the People, Process, and Culture 
 Why Transform Your Business Digitally? — A History Lesson through the 4 Gears 
 The Offensive Logic to Digital Transformation — Customer Experience 
 Gear Up for theNext Level of Digital Engagement 
 The Right Start — The Behavior Economics of Successful Digital Transformation: Part 1 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Digital Transformation vs. the 4-Gears Model&nbsp; 
     The 4-gears model is a sustainable business model in the digital age. It identifies what businesses must do differently to stay competitive in the digital marketplace (i.e. they must learn to engage and enlist in addition to acquire and monetize). But it doesn’t show us how to get there or even where to begin. In fact, since the 4-gears model is a loop, you can begin anywhere, as long as you can get all 4 gears to spin in sync eventually. 
 &nbsp; 
 On the other hand, DT can be view as the programmatic execution of the required changes for companies to learn to spin the 2 new gears, and eventually get all 4 gears in sync. Think of the 4-gears model as a snapshot of the final operating state of a thriving enterprise in the digital age. Then DT is a roadmap that shows us how to get to that final state. It guides the implementation of all the necessary technologies, processes, and programs to transforms the company from its current state (2-gears) to the final state (4-gears). 
 &nbsp; 
 As such, DT is often a multi-year journey. It invariably starts with the adoption of some digital technologies to transforms one part of your business operation. But it must eventually change the people, process, and the culture throughout your entire company in order to last. This is very difficult, because many things could change over the course of such a long journey—stakeholders may leave, funding may be cut, and the technology could change dramatically. When such disruptions occur along the DT journey, corporate inertia will often revert the company back to business as usual (2-gears), which will eventually kill the business. 
 &nbsp; 
 How can we mitigate the detrimental impacts of these external factors that we don’t control? 
 &nbsp; 
 Overcoming Corporate Inertia with Baby Steps 
 The solution is to approach this massive transformation in a more agile fashion, with smaller increments and more iterations toward the final outcome. This is also known as the principle of baby steps in behavior economics and gamification, which can effectively drive the organizational learning and behavior changes introduced by DT. This principle has 2 phases: 
 
 Pick the right starting point: You must start any change with something that people are familiar with and are already doing (i.e. acquisition or monetization). This will achieve the lowest barrier of entry, and therefore maximize the initial adoption rate. 
 Build a ramp to the final goal: You must break up any big change into smaller intermediary steps to create a ramp. This will make it easier for people to advance towards the final behavior outcome (i.e. getting all 4 gears to spin in sync), and lower the abandon rate during the process. 
 
 &nbsp; 
     By applying baby steps to DT, we are essentially driving the largest possible population as far along the transformation process as possible. We’ve already discussed phase 1 in the previous post of this mini-series. Although we can, in theory, begin the DT journey with the monetization gear (e.g. with mobile payment, IoT, etc.), it’s much easier to start with the acquisition gear (see the previous post for explanation). 
 &nbsp; 
 Today, we will address phase 2. Because the precise ramp is dependent on your vision, we will use the example of a social-driven DT to illustrate the ramp from acquisition to enlistment. 
 &nbsp; 
 Building the Ramp from Acquisition to Enlistment&nbsp; 
 Start with social acquisition (marketing): Publish hyper-relevant content on social channels (i.e. the right content, on the right channel, at the right time). Since this is where we will begin our DT journey, it will need to have the 3 success ingredients from the start: 
 
 Customer centricity: It must improve the customer experience (CX) for your customers. 
 A clear vision of what DT means to your business: It must improve your marketing performance as measured by standard marketing KPIs. 
 The right technology: It must improve their productivity of your marketing team and simplify their work through integration. 
 
 Since this is something that brands already do and understand, there is no need to create any urgency or compelling event to sell it. The improved marketing performance and employee productivity should suffice to drive the initial adoption. 
 &nbsp; 
 Due to the hyper-relevant nature of these content, consumers will naturally engage them more frequently. This immediately puts the ball back in the brand’s court. The need to respond to customer reactions, comments, or inquiries will compel brands to start engaging with their customers. The better your social marketing perform, the more conversation there will be for you to respond, which creates a greater need to engage. So this is a natural ramp to spin the next gear—engagement. 
 &nbsp; 
 Once brands start to engage on social media, they will quickly discover the immense scale of social. They will realize that no matter how much they try, they just can’t respond to all the conversations on the social web. The desire to scale their engagement will naturally compel brands to enlist customers for help. Again, the more you engage and the deeper you engage, the more you will need to scale, which creates a greater need to enlist. This is another natural ramp to spin the next gear—enlistment. 
 &nbsp; 
     Evidently, going from acquisition to engagement, and then to enlistment is a course of natural progression. The success of each step along the way creates the urgency and need for the next. During this progression, brands will gain sophistication with social interactions and be more comfortable with the lack of control. They will also recognize the long-term value of engaging and enlisting customers and be more comfortable with the delayed ROI. Meanwhile, this also gives brands the time to learn the best practice to manage their social customers and implement the internal processes to help them realize the full potential of enlistment. For example, tribal knowledge creation, crowdsourced ideation and prioritization on product improvements, and co-creation of new product and services. 
 &nbsp; 
 By building this ramp from acquisition to enlistment, many of the common objections for diving in with engagement and enlistment can be resolved along the way as you mature. Of course, the right technology must also be in place to facilitate the spinning of the 2 new gears (i.e. engage and enlist). 
 &nbsp; 
 Conclusion 
 Today, we accomplished 2 things. First, we clarified the relationship between the 4-gears model and DT. The 4-gears model provides an image of what a thriving and sustainable digital business will look like operationally. In contrast, DT provides the roadmap that helps organizations get there by implementing the necessary changes in technologies, processes, programs, etc. 
 &nbsp; 
 Second, we’ve demonstrated the power of baby steps in overcoming corporate inertia. So if we use baby steps to (1) choose the right starting point and (2) build a ramp to the final outcome, we can use it to drive the organizational changes introduced by DT effectively. Specifically, we can leverage baby steps to drive the shift from the traditional 2-gears model to the future-proof 4-gears model. 
 &nbsp; 
 What does this mean to you? 
 &nbsp; 
 If you are hitting walls trying to get your business to engage and enlist, it’s not your fault. Your organization and leadership are just conservative. The solution from behavior economics is to not start with engagement or enlistment, even though that’s where you want your company to go. Instead, start with acquisition—marketing (which your business is already doing) and demonstrate the superior result of your digitally transformed social marketing. Then just look ahead and plan along, because the rest of the DT journey will gently reveal itself due to the ramp we created from the baby steps principle.

					 Let’s continue the discussion of digital transformation (DT), but we will take a different perspective today. As some of you might know, I’ve always had a keen interest in human behavior. I’ve published many articles on gamification, behavior economics, and its application in the business world. Since DT is typically a multi-year project with many stakeholders and complex human factors, perhaps we can apply a little behavior economics (or even gamification) to this transformation process. 
 &nbsp; 
 However, DT is also a journey that starts with the adoption of some technology to transform some part of your business, where should you start? We’ve already learned that a customer-centric DT strategy is crucial to paving the road to success, but there are still many parts of a business that could interact with customers. How should you phase this multi-year project? Where should it end up? These are the questions we will explore over the next few posts. Today we will focus on choosing the right starting point. 
 &nbsp; 
 If you missed the previous blog posts on this topic, I recommend reviewing some of the background materials before moving forward. The related blog posts can be accessed here: 
 
 Successful Digital Transformation Must Go Beyond Digital to the People, Process, and Culture 
 Why Transform Your Business Digitally? — A History Lesson through the 4 Gears 
 The Offensive Logic to Digital Transformation — Customer Experience 
 Gear Up for the Next Level of Digital Engagement 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Engagement is Hard, Enlistment is Even Harder 
     From the 4-gears model, we know that business must learn to spin the engagement and enlistment gears in order to survive the digital disruption. So it’s natural for practitioners to start spinning these 2 gears right from the beginning. There is nothing wrong with this. Many digital visionaries have already gone down this path, and they are enjoying the fame and glory from their success. But it really takes a visionary who have a strong conviction (which is rare) to pull this through. However, most business people are pragmatists and conservatives. How should the majority of the businesses (~68%) tackle DT? 
 &nbsp; 
 The answer is simple: don’t start with engagement or enlistment, because these 2 gears are relatively new compared to acquisition and monetization. Most enterprises have a natural tendency to resist jumping into something new that they don’t fully understand. Although many brands (even the conservative ones) understand the need to engage, many practitioners are still being held back. Here are some of the most common reasons for their resistance. 
 
 Lack of urgency: it’s a nice-to-have, not a must-have, so it can wait 
 Lack of resources: both funding and human resources 
 Lack of industry best practice (although this is changing as we speak): companies must learn to engage and manage customers (in the case of enlistment) who probably don’t want to have a relationship with the brand 
 Lack of standard ROI models for different engagement and enlistment use cases (this is also changing) 
 Incomplete measure of engagement: missing the depth dimension of engagement 
 
 &nbsp; 
 In addition to the common objections for diving in with engagement, enlistment often faces a few extra challenges of its own. 
 
 Unfamiliarity: most enterprises probably never even heard of enlistment, but related concepts, like crowdsourcing, is gaining popularity in business 
 Lack of business processes for enlistment: successful enlistment requires brands to incorporate customers’ voices into their company’s routine operation, but many companies don’t have any of these processes in place 
 Lack of control: enlistment require the business to collaborate and rely on customers, but the company has no control over what their customers will do or say 
 Long time-to-ROI: even in cases where a clear positive ROI is demonstrable, it is only realizable much later, because it takes a long time to enlist customers 
 
 To overcome all these challenges within a traditional company is truly a herculean effort, and that is why those who did it deserve the fame and glory of heroes. 
 &nbsp; 
 Where Should You Begin Your Digital Transformation Journey? 
 If your DT efforts were dismissed, perhaps your organization isn’t ready for prime-time engagement and enlistment yet. That doesn’t mean you should just sit and wait, because the price of doing nothing may be the end of your business. So this is where you need to apply a little behavior design or gamification to drive the adoption behavior of your organization. 
 &nbsp; 
     &nbsp;One of the most powerful behavior-driving principles for large groups of people with disparate motivation is the concept of baby steps. In fact, this principle is so crucial that it’s one of the core tenets of successful gamification. The idea is simple and has 2 phases. First, if you want an organization to adopt something new and unfamiliar, it’s best to start from something that they already know and are already doing. The next phase involves building a ramp for your company to advance towards the final behavior outcome, and we will cover this in the next post. 
 &nbsp; 
 If the final behavior is for your company to learn to engage and enlist your customers (which they haven’t started), then you should not start with these 2 gears. The fact that they have not started engaging or enlisting by now means that these 2 gears are probably too challenging for your organization. You must start with one of the gears they are already spinning—acquisition (marketing) or monetization (transaction). 
 &nbsp; 
 In theory, it doesn’t matter which gear you choose to begin your DT journey, since the 4 gears is a loop anyway. In practice, however, it’s a lot easier to start with acquisition for several reasons: 
 
 Most of the enterprises (even the pragmatists and conservatives) are either already doing some forms of digital acquisition. 
 It’s much easier to create a customer-centric strategy around digital acquisition, and customer centricity is crucial to the long-term success of your DT initiative. 
 There are also a lot more technologies in the market that can help you digitally transform your acquisition gear than do the monetization gear. If you don't believe me, just take a look at this marketing technology landscape infographic. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Digitally Transforming Your Acquisition Gear 
 Now that we have chosen to begin your DT journey with acquisition (i.e. marketing), how should you transform this business function digitally? I wish I could to tell you, but unfortunately, this is unique for every business. More specifically, it depends on your vision of what DT really means to your brand. And this can be very different for every organization. 
 &nbsp; 
 Now, you might recall from the first vlog entry of this mini-series where we discuss the 3 most important failure modes that must be addressed at the beginning of every DT project. Addressing these failure modes has led to the 3 initial ingredients that are crucial to the long-term success of DT projects: 
 
 A customer-centric strategy 
 A clear vision of what DT means to your business 
 The right technology that is fully integrated into your digital ecosystem and simple to use 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Since we are beginning the DT journey with acquisition, we must make sure these 3 ingredients are present from the get-go. This can often be established with the 3 sets of questions below: 
 
 Do you have a customer-centric acquisition strategy? Are you improving the customer experience (CX) when acquiring their attention on digital channels? Since a good CX during acquisition often means more relevant and personalized messaging, are your marketing content personalized? Are they hyper-personalized? 
 Is your DT helping your business acquire more effectively and more efficiently? Since acquisition (marketing) is something that every company already does, there is an established standard to measure its performance. So are you improving the performance of your existing marketing efforts? Can you measure this improvement by standard marketing KPIs? 
 Can the new technology be fully integrated with the rest of your marketing technologies? Does the technology simplify your marketing team’s work? Can your marketing team use the technology without much training? Does the technology increase the efficiency and productivity of your marketing team even factoring in the learning curve? 
 
 If the answer is “YES” for all the questions above, then the DT of your marketing operation is on the right track. 
 &nbsp; 
 Conclusion      Starting your DT journey by engaging and enlisting customer is often difficult (though not impossible) for most of the traditional enterprises. Because these 2 gears are relatively new compared to the acquisition and monetization gears, many DT practitioners still get pushed back when starting with the engagement or enlistment gears. We can apply the principle of baby steps to increase the success rate of this challenging transformation process. This is accomplished by starting with the acquisition gear (i.e. marketing), because most companies are already familiar with marketing and are already doing it. 
 &nbsp; 
 How you transform your marketing with digital technology is specific to your business, but it must contain the following 3 success ingredients: 
 
 Improving the CX for your customers 
 Improving the performance of your company’s marketing KPIs 
 Improving the productivity of your marketing teams 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Picking the right place to start is an important first step. Next time we’ll build the ramp that enables your company to take baby steps toward the final behavior outcome—thriving in today’s digital economy. And that will require all 4 gears (i.e. acquire, engage, monetize, enlist) to spin in sync.

					 Over the past 2 entries of this digital transformation (DT) series, we’ve gained a deeper understanding for both the defensive and offensive reasons why DT is an inevitable course for modern enterprises. We’ve also introduced the 4 gears model to help us understand why that is the case. Today, we will dive deeper to understand the 2 new gears (i.e. engage and enlist) of the 4 gears model.

 Successful Digital Transformation Must Go Beyond Digital to the People, Process, and Culture 
 Why Transform Your Business Digitally? — A History Lesson through the 4 Gears 
 The Offensive Logic to Digital Transformation — Customer Experience 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Most modern enterprises are already familiar with acquisition and monetization, because they had over a century of practice spinning these 2 gears. Engagement and enlistment are relatively new to the business world, especially enlistment, but brands must learn to spin these 2 gears to survive. So how should brands view these 2 new gears? 
 &nbsp; 
 A Deeper Look at Customer Engagement 
     Today, the concept of customer engagement is not foreign to brands, and most marketers understand that it’s simply any interaction between the customers and the brand. However, many brands fail to understand one crucial point about engagement; and that is, it has 2 dimensions: both breadth (how many) and depth (how deep). 
 &nbsp; 
 This is very different from acquisition, where the only dimension of concern is breadth—how many people’s attention you’ve acquired (recall that the acquisition gear is merely acquiring attentions). Due to people’s familiarity with acquisition, many practitioners today are still quantifying engagement using only the breadth measure (i.e. some variants of how many you’ve engaged). Although this is not completely wrong, it’s missing half of the story. Moreover, the depth of engagement is arguably even more important than the breadth of engagement. Let’s try to understand why. 
 &nbsp; 
 The 4 gears model clearly shows the engagement gear feeding into the monetization gear. This means the ultimate purpose of engagement should be to help you sustain monetization by capturing the consumer’s attention longer. In practice, the most important outcome of engaging your customers is that you will build stronger relationships with them. The stronger customer relationships imply that these customers will be more loyal, which manifests in more repeat business with you, and hence help you sustain monetization. 
 &nbsp; 
 Now, given that both the breadth and the depth of engagement are important, do you think it’s the breadth or depth that is going to help you build stronger relationships with your customers? 
 &nbsp; 
 The answer should be clear. Engaging millions with no depth is useless, because it’s not going to help you sustain monetization. But the contrary is also true: engaging deeply with only a few is probably not going to impact your monetization significantly either. Brands must learn to balance these 2 dimensions of engagement to optimize its long-term impact on monetization. More importantly, brands must gain sophistication with spinning the engagement gear, and not just blindly follow other’s engagement tactic. Engagement that doesn’t end up building stronger relationships with your customer and lead to more loyal customers is a waste of resources. 
 &nbsp; 
 A Very Brief History of Engagement 
 Today, quite a few digitally savvy brands are starting to get a hang of social engagements. But this was not the case about 7 years ago (i.e. around 2010). Back then, most brands still didn’t understand why they need to engage their customers. Many are still operating under the traditional 2 gears model (i.e. focused only on the acquisition and monetization gears). But today (7 years later), every brand I talk to knows they need to engage. 
 &nbsp; 
     This doesn’t mean brands have perfected the art of engagement yet. Clearly, brands can’t master engagement when they don’t even measure it accurately, due to the lack of a metric for engagement depth. Brands still have many questions about engagement. For example, who should you engage? Do you engage influencers or all customer? How do you prioritize them? How to engage them most effectively? When and where should you engage, which channels? And what’s the ROI of engagement? 
 &nbsp; 
 Despite all the unknowns and uncertainties around customer engagement, one thing that every company agrees on is the fact that they need to do it. It's well known that innovation adoption is not uniform. The innovators and visionaries will lead the pack, but they are typically a small fraction of the population (~16%). The bulk of the population are pragmatists (~34%, a.k.a. the early majority) and conservatives (~34%, a.k.a. the late majority) who will catch up slowly. 
 &nbsp; 
 It took ~7 years for even the conservatives (i.e. the late majority) to recognize the importance of customer engagement, and it will probably take a few more years before brands master it. Although this sounds like a long time, it’s relatively short compared to the business transformation created by the transportation and communication revolution (where companies switch from a 1-gear to a 2-gears operation). 
 &nbsp; 
 Now, if you are the innovators and visionaries, you probably already engage your customers. So the natural question is, “what comes next?” 
 &nbsp; 
 From Engagement to Enlistment 
 The next gear that brands must learn to spin is enlistment, which is to leverage your customer to help you do work that’s normally done within your enterprise. Unlike engagement, customer enlistment is still a foreign concept to many brands. Enlistment today is like engagement ~7 years ago. Many brands don’t know what is it, or why they need to enlist customer when they have employees. However, this gear is crucial because it closes the feedback loop, and it’s what makes this model scalable and sustainable in the digital age. 
 &nbsp; 
 Despite its importance, customers are not obliged to help any brand in any way, and they are not going help you just because you want to enlist them. So how do you spin the enlistment gear? 
 &nbsp; 
 To answer this riddle, we need to understand the relationship between engagement and enlistment. The way to think about these 2 new gears is that they are simply the 2 extremes of a continuous engagement spectrum. Since engagement is any interaction between the consumer and the brand, it covers everything consumers do that touches the brand. Whether it’s visiting the brand’s store, watching an ad about their new product, liking/sharing a video they published, or getting help from their support agent, all are valid forms of engagement.&nbsp; 
      
 &nbsp; 
 The key is recognized that every engagement with a brand has a different depth. So engagement is really a whole spectrum of interactions ranging from the shallowest (passive engagement) to the deepest (active engagement). The depth of engagement correlates with the amount of consumer resource required (e.g. time, effort, etc.). So the engagement spectrum starts with activities that require little effort: consume, share, curate, to create, and finally to co-create, which could require a lot of time, effort, and even mental resources. 
 &nbsp; 
 When customers are co-creating with you, they will be collaborating with your product or design teams to help create a better product. Since customers are not obliged to collaborate with you or help you do anything, when they are co-creating with you, they are definitely enlisted. But enlistment starts much earlier on the engagement spectrum. When customers are sharing your content with their friends (which they are also not obligated), they are helping you market your product, which is normally done by your marketing team. So sharing can be viewed as a light form of enlistment. 
 &nbsp; 
 Evidently, engage and enlist are just the 2 ends of a continuous spectrum. Enlistment is just the deepest form of engagement. And engagement is just a very shallow form of enlistment, with possibly the exception of “consume,” because it’s unclear how consumption of brand content helps anyone in your company do his/her work. So, if you are one of those savvy brands who is already engaging customers digitally, you are on the right path to customer enlistment. Just engage your customer deeper. Before long, your customers will start helping you out, if you make helping easy and rewarding. 
 &nbsp; 
 Conclusion 
 To survive the digital revolution, brands must adopt a new strategic model that involves spinning all 4-gears (i.e. Geoffrey Moore’s 4 gears model: acquire, engage, monetize, enlist). Companies must learn to spin the engagement and enlistment gears in addition to the familiar acquisition (marketing) and monetization (transaction) gears. Although many brands are already engaging their customers, few have the process and analytics to get to the goal of engagement, which is to help you sustain monetization by building stronger relationships with your customers. 
 &nbsp; 
 On the contrary, enlistment (leveraging customers to help out different aspects of your business) is still a foreign concept. To start spinning the enlistment gear, companies need to start paying more attention to an important but overlooked dimension of engagement—its depth. This reveals the relationship between engagement and enlistment: they are merely the 2 ends of a continuous spectrum. So getting to the next level of digital engagement may be easier than you think, because the next level of digital engagement is enlistment. So, just continue engaging your customers deeper and deeper, to the point that they become willing and want to help your employees and other customers.

					 Welcome back to my mini-series on digital transformation (DT). This is the 3rd installment of this mini-series. Previous blog entries can be accessed via the following posts: 
 
 Successful Digital Transformation Must Go Beyond Digital to the People, Process, and Culture 
 Why Transform Your Business Digitally? — A History Lesson through the 4 Gears 
 
 &nbsp; 
 In my last blog entry, we learned that technology-driven business transformation, such as DT, is not new and has happened throughout human history. History also revealed a defensive argument for companies to transform digitally. Companies must transform themselves to take advantage of the new technologies, otherwise, they won’t exist very long. 
 &nbsp; 
 More importantly, we introduced the 4 gears model that could guide you through this transformation process. Companies must evolve from the operating norm that only focuses on 2 gears (i.e. acquisition and monetization) to the new model that also focuses on engagement and enlistment. Today, we will examine the 4 gears model in greater detail to reveal the offensive logic for companies to transform their business digitally. 
 &nbsp; 
 The Ultimate Differentiator in a World of Mass Commoditization&nbsp; 
     As the market becomes more competitive, many products and services are being commoditized, where they become indistinguishable in the consumers’ eyes except their price. Therefore, companies engage in price wars constantly to stay competitive. This squeezes the profit margin of brands and threatens their business. Consequently, brands are struggling to differentiate in order to avert the commoditization of their products/services. 
 &nbsp; 
 Today, many brands focus on customer experience (CX) as the ultimate differentiator. This is confirmed by a survey conducted by Gartner, which reports that 89% of the companies are expected to compete on CX. There are at least 2 good reasons for this: 
 
 Effectiveness: The most powerful and direct way to make consumers truly understand how your brand is different is to make them feel It’s much less effective to tell or even to show consumers how your products/services are different, because they won’t feel it. Besides, consumers will always discount what you said due to their inherent distrust in brands. 
 Irreplicability: Other competitors may be able to replicate your products/services, but it is operationally much harder to replicate the entire CX throughout the customer journey. Because CX can be affected in so many different touchpoints. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Digital transformation can help companies provide their customers a better CX. If done right, companies can even deliver a unique CX for everyone—a hyper-personalized experience that is optimized for a single individual. In order to deliver a hyper-personalized experience for everyone, brands must master 2 prerequisites as part of their business operation: 
 
 Collect enough data about their customer to understand each one’s unique preferences 
 Deliver a unique (therefore hyper-personalized) experience for each customer based on the individual’s preference data 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Digital transformation can help brands realize hyper-personalization because it’s much easier to achieve both prerequisites above in the digital space. That is the digital advantage. Companies that engage their consumers digitally have an edge over those who don’t, because they can: 
 
 collect more data about their customers to understand them better 
 deliver a more relevant and personalized experience to their customers 
 
 Surely a hyper-personalized CX will help brands get more attention from their consumers, but it will also help brands win the engagement game and start spinning the engagement (and enlistment) gears. 
 &nbsp; 
 The 4 Gears Create a Journey, Which Creates Experiences 
 Over the past century, businesses had much time to optimize the 2 gears model with many technologies that were invented along the way. Consequently, both the acquisition and monetization gears can spin very fast; they are so efficient that they can pretty much happen instantaneously. It only takes a few seconds to swipe your card, tap your phone, or simply click a button to monetize a consumer. Likewise, it takes anywhere from seconds to minute to capture a consumer’s attention with all the media impressions around us. Moreover, consumers expect acquisition and monetization to be fast, so most of them wouldn’t want to spend more than a few minutes with brands on these 2 gears.&nbsp; 
      
 &nbsp; 
 The interesting question is, when do consumers ever seek out and want to spend time with a brand? There are actually 2 windows along the customer journey where this happens. 
 
 The pre-purchase window (a.k.a. the explore and evaluate phase) 
 The post-purchase window (a.k.a. the use and service/care phase) 
 
 If we map the 4 gears model to the customer journey, these 2 opportune windows correspond to the 2 new gears. During the pre-purchase window is when you should engage your customers, and during the post-purchase window is when you should enlist them.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;By introducing the engagement and enlistment gears, the 4 gears model effectively created a journey for businesses that coincides with the customer’s journey. The implication is that brands that take engagement and enlistment seriously will gain many more opportunity to interact with customers throughout their journey. This is important because it serves as the foundation for companies to compete on the basis of CX in a market where everything else is being commoditized. 
 &nbsp; 
 I must emphasize that a journey is what creates memorable experiences for people. Because acquisition and monetization happen so quickly, there is almost no time for any meaningful experiences to develop. Moreover, you can’t artificially slow down acquisition or monetization either, because consumers would feel that’s an unpleasant experience. By focusing on engagement and enlistment, you could create effective touchpoints that your customers want to interact with. And if you go further to improve the CX at those touchpoints, you could effectively redefine your customers’ experience with the brand. 
 &nbsp; 
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
     As you can see, the 4 gears model is really a CX-centric model that helps sustain your business in the digital age. This model has already revealed a defensive reason for businesses to transform themselves digitally (see my previous entry). The logic is simple. They must in order to ensure the long-term viability of their business. 
 &nbsp; 
 The offensive logic for digital transformation is also simple. Brands have 2 fates in today’s highly competitive world. They can either let competition drive their product and services to mass commoditization, or they can choose to differentiate. Since the ultimate differentiator is CX (due to their effectiveness and irreplicability), brands must transform themselves digitally to exploit the digital advantages that enable them to deliver the optimal CX—personalization. 
 &nbsp; 
 Interestingly, the 4 gears model also provides the strategic framework that helps brands deliver a better CX. It does so by creating 2 extra gears that force modern enterprises to focus on engagement and enlistment in addition to the 2 conventional gears (i.e. acquisition and monetization). This effectively creates a journey for consumers to engage with brands during their pre- and post-purchase window. Consequently, brands that choose the engage and enlist will gain the golden opportunity to create the optimal (personalized) CX for their customers.
